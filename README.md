# CS3735: Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains my implementations and experiments for CS3735: Introduction to Machine Learning at the University of New Brunswick (Winter 2025).

## Course Overview
This course covers the principles and algorithms of machine learning, including both traditional ML approaches and deep learning techniques. Throughout the semester, I've implemented various algorithms from scratch and applied existing libraries to solve classification and regression problems on real-world datasets.

## Topics Covered
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear and Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees and Random Forests
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
  - Support Vector Machines
  
- **Deep Learning**
  - Multilayer Perceptrons
  - Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Activation Functions and Optimizers
  
- **Other Topics**
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Model Evaluation
  - Feature Engineering
